# A pure function has two rule

# Given the same input it will always return the same output
# A function should not produce any side effects, side effects are things are function does that affects the outside world(e.g a func touching a variable in the global scope)

# When you have pure functions testing becomes easy, u have less buggy code

# Pure function is more of a guideline
