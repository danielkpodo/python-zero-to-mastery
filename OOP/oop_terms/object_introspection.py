# This means the ability to detect the type of an object at runtime ( When the code is running)

# This process helps to figure out what we have access to

# It provides us with a helper func to see what we have access to -> we use print(dir(objectname or instance))
# Also whenever we use dot(.) on a datatype it uses instrospection to list out what we have access to
