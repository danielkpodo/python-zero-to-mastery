# Think of tuples as an immutable list of items. If you want an item that won't change then tuples are your friend
# They are less flexible than list thus thhey are more performant

student_ages = (100, 39, 99, 90)
print(student_ages[0])

# You can also loop over a tuple using in

# you can also perform slicing on tuples
# you can also perform list unpacking on tuples


# Tuples 2 methods are
# .count() -> returns number of occurrence of tuple
# .index() -> returns an index of a number
