# Learning Python with Zero-to-Mastery Academy

_My Journery in mastering python_

- Creater of python is `Guido Van Rosum`
- Legacy code is a code written in an old version, and probably needs upgrading
- The reason there are so many programming languages is that every programming lang excels at some things and does'nt do so well at others
- By teaching others you will automatically store most concepts
- In order to effectively master any programming language there are four things you need to master
  - Terms e.g, statements, variables, expressions
  - Datatypes
  - Actions
  - Best practices
- A datatype is a value in python
- Do not memorize things, understand what exist, how to use and always google
- Essential: Do not learn a lang as if you are learning to get 100% on a test
- A good code has to be
  - clean
  - predictable
  - readable
  - DRY
